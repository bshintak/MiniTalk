Project of the school 42 that you must create a communication program in the form of a client and a server.

The instructions were given in the [subject](https://github.com/bshintak/Minitalk/blob/master/subject_minitalk.pdf).
 
 ### Mandatory

- Produce `server` & `client` executables
- `client` must communicate a string passed as a parameter to `server`
- `server` must display the message passed by the `client`
- Use `SIGUSR1` & `SIGUSR2`

### Bonus

- The server acknowledges every message received by sending back a signal to the client
- Support Unicode characters
